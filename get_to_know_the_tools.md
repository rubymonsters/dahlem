# 1. Get to know the terminal

Weâ€™re going to familiarize ourselves with moving around our folders without using the graphical interface

When you start the terminal the `bash` program starts off automatically and leaves you with the `command prompt`, which looks like this:  `$`.

When the command prompt is not visible you cannot execute new commands.
Let's start with a command that prints your current working directory

    pwd

With ls you can get a list of all the content in that directory:

    ls

To get into one directory run cd followed by the name of that directory:

    cd Documents

To get one level up again run

    cd ..

A short-cut to your home directory is the tilde: `~`

<span class="lead coach"><i class="icon-comment-alt"> Coach</i>: You can talk about auto-completion with the tab command</span>

Now navigate to the place in your folders where you want to store all Rails Girls tutorial materials and exercises. To create a directory named "railsgirls" run:

    mkdir railsgirls

Now move into that directory:

    cd railsgirls

Let's create a text file there:

    touch hello.txt

Let's type ls to see if it is there:

    ls

Let's open that file in your editor. Open your editor and in the menubar use File>>Open to open the file.
Save this text there:

    "This is some example text in my text file"

You can look at the content of your text file using cat in the terminal:

    cat hello.txt


# 2. Get to know the irb program


Now let's open a ruby terminal

    irb

As you notice the command prompt is gone and we have entered another program on our terminal called the ruby terminal.
The ruby terminal is an environment that understands and executes ruby code. You can try out all commands you did during this tutorial: `http://tryruby.org` which is a browser based ruby environment.

You can quite `irb` anytime by typing `exit`.

## Strings and Integers

Any English language literal needs to be put into quotation marks ("" or ''), they are called strings:

    "Hello World"

These quotation marks are not needed for numbers:

    1 + 5

Ruby knows integers, no need to mark them specifically.

## Variables

Let's store something in a variable:

    planet = "earth"

Variable names are always written in lower caps.

Let's output the variable

    planet
As you can see the ruby terminal gives you feedback on what you typed. We can also call it the return value.

You can also output any string:

    "earth"

Just like any number or math:

    55555

Overwrite our variable with another value:

    planet = "mars"

Greet the planet using a string and a variable:

    puts "Hello" + planet

Add an empty space:

    puts "Hello " + planet

Add an exclamation mark:

    puts "Hello " + planet + "!"

Capitalize the planet:

    puts "Hello " + planet.upcase + "!"

##Arrays

An array is way how one can store a list or a collection in a certain format. Let's create a list of planets stored in an array. You can imagine it like a bookshelf.

Creating an empty array:

    planets = []

Now we add our variable to that array

    planets.push planet

Let's add some more planets directly (hit enter after each line)

    planets.push "earth"
    planets.push "saturn"
    planets.push "jupiter"

Let's just print out our array

    planets

Look at the size of it:

    planets.size

You can also print the first one:

    planets.first

is the same as

    planets[0]

You should know that an array starts counting with 0. So not existing is this one

    planets[3]


#Saving code in files
As you noticed, anytime you quit `irb` and go back in again, nothing was saved and you have to start all over again. In the long run you will want to save code in files.

So let's create a file for saving ruby code (Linux, Mac OS X):

    touch blabla.rb
    
On Windows:

    type NUL > blabla.rb


Let's open that file in your editor. Open your editor and in the menubar use File>>Open to open the file.
Save this text there:

    puts "Hello"
    puts 1+1
    a = "I am feeling good today"
    print a

You can now run this file in the terminal:

    ruby blabla.rb


If you enjoyed running .rb files in the terminal, here are some more commands you can try out (save the text in the files and run it in the terminal) [Chris Pine LearnToProgram](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=01) tutorial, you can skip any parts that are not that interesting to you, e.g. linewidths in a poem or how old you are in seconds.
